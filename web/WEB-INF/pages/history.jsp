            <li>New antenatal chart, puerperium, safe motherhood, and pregnancy dating forms</li>
            <li>Changes to overall flow of application- mostly in antenatal process. Also, when you select a patient, the app attempts to place you in in the relevant form - if in antenatal, puts you right into the antenatal form;
if in partograph, puts you in partograph.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>April 7, 2005:
        <ul>
            <li>ZEPRS app has alot of changes under-the-hood. Most importantly, encounters are no longer stored in the big "bit bucket;"
            instead, each form has its own table, and metadata about each encounter (date, user logged in, form id, site, etc) is stored in the new "encounter" table.</li>
            <li>When newborn is created, system automatically creates instances of Patient Registration and Newborn Eval forms.
            You now may edit the Patient Registration form for newborn when you have a newborn loaded and click Demographics.
            When you have a newborn loaded the site works similarly to when you have a mother loaded (same menu concepts).  </li>
            <li>Pop-up calendar widget now appears under fields when you scroll - user no longer must scroll up to use calendar widget.
            Be sure to do a hard refresh (shift Control R) to view this change (</li>
            <li>Site Names: Numbering after the site name.</li>
            <li>Empty search results – added a message that states” There are no results for your query.” – table is not even displayed.</li>
            <li>Change DISTRICT ID to be ZEPRS ID.</li>
            <li>All chart items load. EGA calculated each time a form submitted that has a value that is being tracked
            (EGA,Fundal Height,AC,ALB,GLU,Weight,hB,BP,Oedema) and displayed in chart.</li>
            <li>More work done on Problem page items - solved a session bug.</li>
            <li>Deleted extraneous fields in Antenatal Record Exam and Subsequent Visits and fixed date fields that were erroneously storing today's date when form submitted.</li>
            <li>Problem/Labor Visit – bug – antepartum and intrapartum showing up the wrong reasons for evaluation etc – reversed - fixed.</li>
            <li>Problem/Labor Visit – bug – message that Problem/Labor visit needs to be filled out - now displays - fixed</li>
            <li>Added float data type - can now have numbers w/ decimal points.</li>
            <li>System-generated problems:
                <ul>
                <li>System will now evaluate problems when an encounter is being edited.</li>
                <li>The following fields now create info or referral problems:</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>If the diastolic blood pressure is over 110 (mother) : Antenatal Record Exam and Subsequent Visits </li>
                    <li>If the baby has not passed urine or stool: Newborn eval - urine</li>
                    <li>If the Apgar Score is less than 6, then this should trigger an active problem (final apgar score).: Newborn eval: Apgar score, 10 mins.</li>
                    <li>If the temperature is below 36.5, above 37.5 Temp is a shared field – in the following forms:<br/>

            <li>New form - Pregnancy Conclusion - in Delivery Summary/Postnatal flow. This is used to end a pregnancy.

    <li>October 12, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about Tasks, Problems, and Rules:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> During the lifetime of a pregnancy, the clinician must complete a series of forms. The ZEPRS system

    <li>September 8, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Added Navigation section to Patient Home page. This section suggests links for the user to follow,
evoking a "wizard-style" approach, while still giving the user the flexibility to navigate the forms as needed. All of the encounters are broken into phases, or flows. When a user is in a particular flow – such as “init anc – history” – the system guides the user as follows:
            <ul>
            <li>Links to most recent encounters and next encounter </li>
            <li>Drop-down menu for all of the forms in this phase. </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Changed EGA to EGA(calc) - it is now providing a calculation of the EGA from the most recent LMP value. Next step: perform a similar calculation on the most recent estimated EGA.</li>
            <li>Links to the encounter records for the most recent values in the patient bar.</li>
            </ul>
    <li>September 2, 2004:</li>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Shared fields demo: <html:link href="patientHome.do?patientId=1" >Jones, Jane</html:link>
            <br/>This demo shows the capability to display aggregate data about a patient. The data is collected from common fields in several forms and
            presented in a historical view to enable to clinician to see trends.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Aggregate reports on main patient page. This feature is in development. Currently it is presenting data from Postnatal and followup exams.
                We'll soon be able to view reports based on shared fields, such as BP and temp.</li>
            <li>Forms display data from previous entires of the same form. Click "Previous Pregnancies" for example.</li>
            <li>A little design change to accomodate new data and fixed form radio display bug.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>July 12, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Search now searches district patient id in addition to first name, surname, nrc number, and date last modified.
            This district patient id will be in the format used for the ART app and other Zambian medical id's. This will aid integration w/ the ART app.</li>
            <li>When search results are empty, returns a pertinent message.</li>
            <li>Added District Patient ID</li>
            <li>New hierarchical menu system for forms.</li>
            <li>Change “Encounters” heading to “Patient Record”</li>
            <li>Changes to "Problem List" - renamed "Recommended Patient Care" - focuses now strictly on problems.
            Patient context bar made bigger, moved to upper left, below the form menu.</li>
            <li>"Recommended Patient Care" has two main functions:
            <ul>
                <li>If patient has current or previous problems, link titled "Patient Care: Outstanding and Resolved" is displayed.</li>
                <li>If staff encounters problem-triggering conditions during the current session, these are displayed under Outstanding Issues link. </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            <li>Date/time now in title bar</li>
        </ul>
    <li>June 21, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Edit functionality. This is only enabled during your current session - you may not edit previous encounters.</li>
            <li>Changes to patient context bar.</li>
            <li>Re-auth process requires only password.</li>
            <li>'Not Required' no longer displays on dropdown fields - blank instead. </li>
            <li>Current site displayed in browser title bar.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>May 2, 2004:
    <br>The "problem page" function is now available. In order to test it, follow these step: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Search and select a patient.</li>
            <li>From the encounter menu, select "Antenatal" and then its sub-menu item "Pelvis Floor".</li>
            <li>Enter "7" for the first two input fields and enter your user/pass in the Re-auth field.</li>
            <li>Click "Submit"</li>
            <li>The referral and Encounter info will be displayed in the Quick List box on the right side of the page, under "Diagnosis Links."
            Please note that the recommendations are simple examples writeen by a progrmamer, not a doctor.</li>
            <li>This functionality is still in development - only one outcome is currently being persisted. The goal
            is to display a list of all "problems" encountered throughout the sister's meeting with the patient.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>May 2, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>New home page. Image is a placeholder.</li>
            <li>"Problem page" works - displayed in right box. Still need to persist to db and make "problems" be additive.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>April 30, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Alternating row columns for result display.</li>
            <li>Radio buttons on forms are left-justified.</li>
            <li>Search returns better results - see search page for better desciption of what it returns..</li>
            <li>Re-authorization on form pages works.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>April 29, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Any enumeration that has less then three values is rendered as a radio button, rather than a drop-down.
This will improve unability of forms that have many "Yes/No" answers, such as "History:Past Medical History."</li>
            <li>The first enumeration of a drop-down form field is labelled "Not Recorded." If "Not Recorded" is selected, its value is not recorded into the database.
This behaviour is different when the value "Not Done" is selected - such a value is saved to the database. </li>
            <li>Username appears as first item in title bar, which will make it easier to identify sessions when the browser is minimized. </li>
            <li>After a patient is selected, a new block appears in the right-side of the page. This block displays the following items:
                <ul>
                    <li>Current time: Wed Apr 28 16:44:37 CAT 2004</li>
                    <li>User: cekelley01</li>
                    <li>Clinic: Bauleni</li>
                    <li>Patient: Berry, Charlene</li>
                    <li>NRC #: 123456/12/2</li>
                    <li>ZEPRS ID: 2</li>
               </ul>
               This same block will display problem page information, or links to referral application. List of problems that need to be solved for this patient
                (links to necessary forms) appear in this section.
               Any unresolved items that occur during the course of a user session will appear in this section.
               This list is persistent - it will appear the next time this patient record is accessed. <em>Note:</em> This feature is still in development.
            <li>The administration for forms has been improved - one may not add enumerations. Be sure to read the instructions in the admin section.
            </li>
            <li>The encounter menu, which appears after a patient has been selected, is used to locate relevant forms.
It is sorted by the perinatal process: history(collect patient data), Ante, Intra, Obstetrics, Delivery, etc. Utility functions,
such as Lab and Record (patient record listing) follow. although we do not have an Admin interface to change/add tabs,
it would fairly easy to administer from Access via ODBC or mysqlcc.</li>
             <li>Re-authorisation on encounter forms is not implemented yet.</li>
             <li>Auto-calculation of values from database on forms (such as EGA) encounter forms is not implemented yet.</li>
             <li>Support for re-useable enumerations, such as druglist, is not implemented yet.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>April 19, 2004:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>After you search for or create a new patient, a tabbed menu appears on the top nav. You may use this tabbed menu to add encounters to the patient record.</li>
            <li>To view the list of encounters currently in a patient record, click "Record" on the tabbed menu (last item). </li>
            <li>Loaded Medical record into tabbed menus.</li>
            <li>Implemented subtabs, which link to the encounter forms.</li>
            <li>Site UI changes - left nav is narrower, to acocmodate wider tabs. </li>
        </ul>
    <li>March 25, 2004:
        <ul>
            <li>Testing tabbed menus. Make sure you click Shift+reload to view these.</li>
            <li>Testing multiple sessions in same browsers. Passing session in URL. </li>
        </ul>
